# World-happiness-level-data-analysis
The dataset I used in the final project is about world happiness report from Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report).

Introduction: The World Happiness report is a worldwide survey contains the
happiness score for 153 countries with factors used to explain the score. It proceeds to
gain worldwide acknowledgement as government, organizations, and society
progressively use happiness index to refine their policy and making critical decisions.

Content: From the website: “World Happiness Report is ranked among 156 Countries
based on a Cantril Ladder Survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are
asked to think of a ladder, the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst
possible experience is a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0
to 10 scale. The columns taking after the bliss score assess the degree to which each of
six variables – financial generation, social back, life anticipation, flexibility,
nonattendance of debasement, and liberality – contribute to making life assessments
higher in each nation than they are in Dystopia, a theoretical nation that has values rise
to the world’s least national midpoints for each of the six variables.”

Analysis of World Happiness Report
I was interested in the following question: which of the factor/factors in the dataset
most correlated to the happiness level?
I think this question is important because the government, the public, society can focus
on making policies and educating themselves to improve those factors, thus ameliorate
the happiness level of their countries. Also, we can reflect on how to help those
countries with low happiness level to make the world a better place.
I will investigate some factors correlated to the happiness level including lifeexpectancy, GDP per capita, gender equality, etc. I will draw plot and modeling those
independent variables to investigate their correlations to happiness level.
